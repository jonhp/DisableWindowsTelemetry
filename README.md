Windows Powershell Script to Disable Windows Telemetry Activities

This Windows Powershell script was "borrowed" from 4sysops.com and then modified.
MS thinks that your windows system is there for their benefit and no matter how you
answer the questions about "opting in", they continue to collect and save data from
your system. This script, thanks to 4sysops, is intended to turn all of that off. If
you find something missing or a problem or whatever, don't hesitate to say something.
However, if you just want to defend MS, please find a more fitting forum.

This script is passed along without warranty or guarantee; use at our own risk.
